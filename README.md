## Introduction
The last two weeks of my time spent at The Tech Academy, I worked on an MVC web application in C# for a theatre in Portland. The website was split into sections that the theatre wanted. Those sections were rentals and production. In this project I worked in a team of fellow students for the rental based section of the site. The team communicated through Discord, and project management was carried out using Azure DevOps. Throughout the project I worked on both the front end and the back end to complete my stories and continue progress of the application. The things I learned on this project I believe will be put to use on many future project whether or not those projects use the same stack or not.
### Story 1
The 1st story I was tasked with was to create an entity model for the Rental class so that rentals could be saved to the database. The first thing I did was create the Rental class where I also created the RentalEquipment and RentalRoom classes that inherited from Rental.

The next thing I did was create the controller and scaffolded the CRUD pages for it.

I then updated the database to create a table in the database to hold all things rentals which at the time didn't have any data inside yet, but in the image it has all the different tests that I tried to ensure things were running smoothly in other parts of the project.
